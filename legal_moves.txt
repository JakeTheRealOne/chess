Before making a move in chess, you should consider the following factors to ensure it's legal:

1. **Piece Movement Rules:** Ensure that the move adheres to the movement rules for the specific piece. For example:
   - **Pawns** move forward one square but capture diagonally.
   - **Knights** move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.
   - **Bishops** move diagonally.
   - **Rooks** move horizontally or vertically.
   - **Queens** combine the movement abilities of both rooks and bishops.
   - **Kings** move one square in any direction.

2. **Check for Check or Checkmate:** Ensure that your move does not place your king in check. You cannot make a move that leaves your king in a position to be captured.

3. **Check for Legal Moves:** Verify that the move does not violate any basic rules of chess, such as moving to a square occupied by your own piece (except for castling and en passant) or moving a piece in a way not permitted by its movement rules.

4. **Castling Rules:** If you are castling, make sure that:
   - Neither the king nor the rook involved has moved before.
   - There are no pieces between the king and the rook.
   - The king is not in check, nor does it pass through or end up in check.

5. **En Passant Rules:** If you are considering an en passant capture, check that:
   - Your opponent's pawn has just moved two squares forward from its starting position.
   - Your capturing pawn is on an adjacent file.

6. **Promotion Rules:** If your pawn reaches the far end of the board, you need to choose a piece to promote to (queen, rook, bishop, or knight).

By keeping these considerations in mind, you can ensure that your move is legal and compliant with the rules of chess.
